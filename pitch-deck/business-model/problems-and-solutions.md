# PROBLEMS & SOLUTIONS

One of the major problems in the current gaming market is the lack of meaningful rewards for players. Many games offer in-game items or virtual currency, but these rewards often have no real-world value and can't be traded or sold. This can lead to a lack of motivation for players and a lack of engagement in the game itself.

Another issue is the limited integration of items and assets between different games. Many players have invested time and money into building up their virtual assets, only to find that they can't transfer or use these assets in other games. This leads to a fragmented gaming market and a lack of incentives for players to switch between games.

In final, many games lack exciting, teachable moments that can be turned into real-world earning opportunities. While some games offer simple in-game jobs or micro-tasks, these are often limited in scope and don't offer real-world value to playersOur game seeks to combat these challenges by providing players with exciting and meaningful rewards for their time and effort. Through the integration of NFTs, our game allows players to truly own their in-game items and assets, and provides a platform for players to trade and sell these assets on the open market. This creates a sense of ownership and attachment to in-game items that is not present in other games.

In addition, our game is designed to provide players with exciting and teachable moments that transfer into real-world earning opportunities. By incorporating in-game challenges and quests that reward players with NFTs, we create a gaming experience that is both engaging and rewarding. This not only keeps players motivated to continue playing, but also provides a unique opportunity for players to earn real-world rewards for their time and effort.

Overall, our game is designed to provide players with a more engaging and rewarding gaming experience that truly recognizes and celebrates their time and effort. By integrating NFTs and providing exciting and meaningful rewards, our game is set to revolutionize the gaming industry and provide players with a more immersive and fulfilling gaming experience
