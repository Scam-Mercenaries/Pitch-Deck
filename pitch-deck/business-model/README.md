# Business Model

The business model for the game involves several key monetary factors, which include:

1. In-game Economics Design: The game's economy will be designed to allow players to buy, sell, and trade virtual assets within the game. This includes land, buildings, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).
2. Pre-launch Land Sale: The game will initiate a pre-launch land sale, which will allow early investors and buyers to purchase virtual land within the game.
3. Pre-sale NFTs Sale: The game will also initiate a pre-sale of NFTs, which will give players the opportunity to own unique, in-game assets before the actual game launch.
4. Capital Investment: The game will require capital investment at several stages of its development. The ideal capital investment plan calls for an initial investment of $100,000, followed by second, third, and final injections of $50,000, $50,000, and $100,000, respectively.
5. Revenue Generation: The game will generate revenue through the sale of virtual assets, including land, buildings, and NFTs. Additionally, the game will have in-game advertisements and sponsorships, which will further boost its revenue.
6. Projected Earnings: The game is projected to generate significant earnings over time, as more players join the game and start trading virtual assets. The actual earnings will depend on several factors, including the number of players, the popularity of the game, and the value of virtual assets within the game.

Overall, the game's business model is designed to provide monetary rewards for investors, by leveraging the popularity of online gaming and the growing market for virtual assets. With the right strategy and execution, the game has the potential to generate significant returns for investors over time
