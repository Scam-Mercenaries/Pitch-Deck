# Untapped Market

The market for education games in the crypto and NFT space is still largely untapped. While there are some educational games and simulations that aim to teach players about cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, there is a lot of room for growth in this area. The popularity of NFTs has created a new demand for educational resources that can help people understand the complex and rapidly-evolving world of crypto and NFTs. This includes educational games that can make learning about these topics fun and engaging. The potential benefits of these games are twofold: they can provide valuable knowledge to players and also serve as a marketing tool to attract people to the crypto and NFT space. By providing educational resources that are both accessible and enjoyable, the crypto and NFT space can continue to grow and evolve in a sustainable way.
