# Lawless World of Crypto

The recent boom in the cryptocurrency market has been accompanied by a surge in fraud cases, yet investigators often lack the resources to effectively address these crimes. This highlights the divide in consumer protections between those who use regulated financial institutions and those who embrace digital currencies.

Cryptocurrency scams occur outside the system of regulated financial institutions and legal protection, making it difficult for law enforcement and investigators to trace the international networks of criminals behind the fraud. The irreversible, anonymous, and global nature of cryptocurrency makes it an attractive target for fraudsters.

Investors who fall victim to these scams may face a long and difficult battle to recover their losses, as the lack of consumer protections leaves them with few options for recourse. This is a concerning issue, particularly as the cost of living crisis is set to worsen and people may be tempted to invest in fake investments.

The anonymity of the individuals behind these scams makes it difficult to bring them to justice, and the international nature of the cryptocurrency market presents additional challenges for investigators. The need for increased resources and protection for cryptocurrency investors is evident, as the trend of crypto fraud shows no signs of slowing down.

The lack of resources for law enforcement and legal authorities makes it difficult for them to tackle and effectively resolve issues related to crypto fraud. Despite a few high-profile wins, the economy of scale that fraudsters can exploit allows them to commit small crimes involving multiple victims in different countries, which often goes unnoticed. This leaves victims with few options, especially those who suffer life-changing financial losses and the loss is relatively low.

In the UK, courts have started to establish a way of recovering stolen crypto through a series of rulings since 2019. However, even with these legal developments, the cost of taking private legal action is often not economically viable for victims who have lost less than Â£1mn. Racheal Muldoon, a barrister who has worked on these cases, says that despite the progress in the UK, it's not possible to help everyone. Often, the amount of crypto is so small that the court fees make it not worthwhile.

Phoebe, a healthcare professional based in New York, was one of the victims who believed that the progress in the UK would help her recoup her stolen crypto worth $800,000. However, she eventually concluded that private legal action would not be viable. The fact that Phoebe was defrauded by scammers posing as fellow Christians facing legal difficulties in the Middle East highlights the dangers of crypto fraud and the importance of resources and efforts to tackle it.
